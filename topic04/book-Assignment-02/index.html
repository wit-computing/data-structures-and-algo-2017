        <h1>Assignment 2</h1>
<p>In this assignment you will extend the Movie recommender solution from the previous assignment to include the following features.</p>

      </div>
     
      <div  class="ui tab segment lab" data-tab="Overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Recommender systems analyse usage patterns to suggest what a user would prefer from among a collection of things he/she has never experienced. For example, fig.1 shows Amazon’s recommendations based on a user’s activity (e.g. other movies they’ve rated etc.). 
<img src="img/main.png" alt="Amazon Recommendations" title="Amazon Recommendations">
You will extend your work from assignment 1 to include the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Import ratings data from MovieLens data set</li>
<li>Provide a simple user interface (console or GUI) that uses the API from assignment 1</li>
<li>Search movies based on title</li>
<li>Calulate the top 10 movies</li>
<li>Calculate movie recommendation for a user</li>
<li>Validation</li>
<li>Analyse your movie search and recommender algorithms indicating order of growth classifications (Empirically and analyicially)</li>
<li>Improve the unit testing of your code</li>
</ul>

      </div>
     
      <div  class="ui tab segment lab" data-tab="Recommendations">
        <h2>Making recommendations</h2>
<p>The following are two possible approaches for implementing the recommendation function.</p>
<h3>Approach 1 (Simplistic):</h3>
<p>A simple approach would be to make almost the same prediction for every member. In this case the program would simply calculate the average rating for all the films in the database, sort the films by rating and then from that sorted list, suggest the top 5 films that the member hasn&#39;t already rated. With this simple approach, the only information unique to the member used by the prediction algorithm was whether or not the member had seen a film.</p>
<h3>Approach 2:</h3>
<p>A better prediction about what a member might like by considering his actual ratings in the past and how these ratings compare to the ratings given by other customers. Consider how you decide on movie recommendations from friends. If a friend tells you about a number of movies that she/he enjoyed and you also enjoyed them, then when your friend recommends another movie that you have never seen, you probably are willing to go see it. On the other hand, if you and a different friend always tend to disagree about movies, you are not likely to go to see a movie this friend recommends.
A program can calculate how similar two users are by treating their ratings as a <em>vector</em> and calculating the dot product of these two vectors (the dot product is just the sum of the products of each of the corresponding elements.) For example, suppose we had 3 films in our database and Paddy rated them [5, 3,-5], Clodagh rated them [1, 5,-3], Ronan rated them [5, -3, 5], and Michael rated them [1, 3, 0]. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The similarity between Paddy and Ronan is:      (5 x 5) + (3 x -3) + (-5 x 5) = 25 - 9 - 25 = -9. 
The similarity between Paddy and Clodagh is: (5 x 1) + (3 x 5) + (-5 x -3) = 5 + 15 + 15 = 35. 
The similarity between Paddy and Michael is:    (5 x 1) + (3 x 3) + (-5 x 0) = 5 + 9 + 0 = 14. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We see that if both people like a film (rating it with a positive number) it increases their similarity and if both people dislike a film (both giving it a negative number) it also increases their similarity.
Once you have calculated the similarity between Paddy and every other customer, you can then identify whose ratings are most similar to Paddy&#39;s. In this case Clodagh is most similar to Paddy, so we would recommend to Paddy the top films from Clodagh&#39;s list that Paddy hadn&#39;t already rated.</p>

      <div  class="ui tab segment lab" data-tab="Searching">
        <h1>Searching</h1>
<p>Your assignment should allow a user to search based on film title. The user can enter a string and the program should return a list of matching films that contain that text. All matching films should be displayed and the search should be case insensitive.</p>
<h2>Weighing</h2>
<p>How should you order the list of matching films? You are probably familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocomplete">Autocomplete </a>  on smart phones and search engines. Most autocomplete application predict how likely it is that the user is typing/searching for an item. For this purpose, each item has a <strong>weight</strong> and your program will use these to compute a list of the top matching terms, in decreasing order of weight.</p>
<p>The weights are calculated using various data, such as number of plays for movie streaming services, frequencies of search queries from other Google users, or the typing history of a smart phone user.
In this assignment, you should use the rating data for the film</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>The performance of autocomplete functionality is critical in many systems. For example, the Google search engine runs an autocomplete application. It also performs this computation for every keystroke typed into the search bar and for every user! Therefore application has to return a list of suggestions in a short time  for it to be useful to the user. It also performs this computation for every keystroke typed into the search bar and for every user!</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocomplete">Autocomplete </a> features in many applications such as search engines(Google), email programs etc.
You would noticed the autocomplete mechanism in the Eclipse Java source code editor.</p>
